                  <h3>WHY Universal?</h3>
                  <p>The message is for the whole world. We not only urge people from India but also from every corner of the world to lend a helping hand and be a part of our mission. We live in a global village today. So India going up the rungs of the Human Development Index (HDI) ladder will definitely have a positive effect on the world on the whole. We are taking an initiative for a better India, which will be a part of a better world at large. It has also been used to signify that we will extend our helping hand to people, irrespective of any discrimination on the grounds of caste, creed, gender, region, religion, sect, etc.</p>
                  <h3>WHY  Live and Let Live?</h3>
                  <p>The phrase “Live and Let Live” are very suggestive of our aim – we live and we help others live. Maybe fate has divided us on privileges but we can bridge the gap if we really have a mind for doing it. Being children of God, we are all equal. In the case of our NGO, we focus on providing two basic amenities of development in the world today – Education and Healthcare. Currently our focus is on education only.</p>
                  <h3>WHY Mission?</h3>
                  <p>The idea behind this word is very simple. We are on a “mission “– a mission where we desire to be a part of making India more enlightened, aware and healthy. Knowledge is power. We don’t want poverty or any other issue to be a hindrance in the path of education. As for healthcare, the availability of basic healthcare services is very poor in India. We will engage ourselves in various philanthropic activities in the healthcare sector at a later stage. Right now, our focus will be on education only.</p>
                  <h3>THE beneficiaries?</h3>
                  <p>No. Not only the members or other people involved with our activities, but the concept also extends to the beneficiaries in the future. We urge all of our past, present and future beneficiaries that once they stand on their own feet, they will help others establish themselves as successful individuals in life. They, along with everybody else will carry on the mission. This will be a never ending process.</p>

                    <h3>Our Aim</h3>
                    <p>
                      Universal Live and Let Live Mission (ULLLM) was founded on 31st January 2009. It was registered on 28th May, 2009 under the West Bengal Societies Registration Act, 1961, vide Registration No. S/1L/60964, with the mission of helping poor students continue their education and also carry out other benevolent and philanthropic activities in the field of healthcare. Right now, we are focusing primarily on helping poor but brilliant students with their education. We aspire to dive into the healthcare sector a bit later.
                    </p>
                    <p>The main objectives of ULLLM are as follows:</p>

                      </li>
                      <li>
                        To promote education among the indigent people by different means.
                      </li>
                      <li>

                        To open, acquire and run charitable medical centres, dispensary, hospitals, etc. for providing medical services to the helpless and other needy persons suffering from HIV- AIDS, cancer and any other diseases.   
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        To arrange and organise medical awareness programmes of any kind.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        To publish or cause to be published useful literatures, magazines pamphlets etc. relating to objects and activities of the Mission.         
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The other objects ULLLM are as follows:</p>

                      </li>
                      <li>
                       To engage in such other benevolent and philanthropic activities as may be deemed appropriate by the Governing Body.

                <div class="container-fluid" class=" " id="piggyconcept">
                    <h3>The concept:</h3>
                    <p>It often happens that after a day’s work, we come home and see maybe a rupee or two in our pocket. Not much at all. And in present days’ worth, it really has no value. Maybe it fulfils a child’s wish of a chocolate or maybe helps us in daily transactions like in shops or auto-rickshaws or bus fares. But in layman terms, they are worth nothing. </p>
                    <p>Wrong!</p>
                    <p>Here we present before you all a novel idea. We say that every rupee matters. Let us think logically. If we are left with a rupee a day, that makes INR 365 a year. Now that’s some amount at least, which is still less considered on a yearly basis. In fact we spend on our luxury that costs us way above this price.</p>
                    <p>We urge each and every one, be it members, volunteers, or anybody else, to save, at least a rupee a day. It can be on behalf of the family as a whole or each person of the family on his/her own. We urge you all to save it for the greater purpose of education for all and for a healthier India, which our NGO aims to propagate and support whole-heartedly. Even your little contributions like this will make a difference at large when all of us will maintain a “piggy bank” and donate its amount to our cause. Again, it extends beyond the purview of membership.
                    </p>
